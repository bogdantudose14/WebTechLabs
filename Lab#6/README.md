The dependencies are included in the package.json file provided by me so you can either install them manually
by running:

           npm install express; 
           npm install body-parser;
           npm install cors;
           
or by simply running:
          
          npm install; 

=> this will look inside the package.json file and install the
dependencies found in the "dependencies" object
