# Having the `function addTokens(input, tokens)` where:
- `input` is a string that could contain "..." for example: Subsemnatul ..., dominiciliat in ...;
- `tokens` is an array with token names .
- The function should replace each `...` from `input` with the values from `tokens` in the following format `${tokenName}`;

# Complete the following tasks:

- `input` should be a `string`. If other type is passed throw an `Error` with the message `Input should be a string`; (0.5 pts)
- `input` should be at least 6 characters long. If `input` length is less than 6 throw an `Error` with the message `Input should have at least 6 characters`; (0.5 pts)
- `tokens` is an array with elements with the following format: `{tokenName: string}`. If this format is not respected throw an `Error` with the following message `Invalid array format`; (0.5 pts)
- If `input` don't contain any `...` return the initial value of `input`; (0.5 pts)
- If `input` contains `...`, replace them with the specific values and return the new `input`; (0.5 pts)
